## Working On My JavaScript Skills!

I've been attempting to code every day during the last half of summer, to try and better develop my skills in preparation of uni. I've been refreshing my C, HTML, CSS and JS skills throughout this time... yet I never seem to actually document any of this work!

These JS projects aren't complicated, or at least they'll build up to being complicated, but it's a way of recording my progress and ensure I keep pushing myself when it comes to coding! 

Currently my projects include:

- Basic Rock Paper Scissors: Nothing fancy, just getting familiar with using JS after a period of not touching it.
